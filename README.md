# GCP-App-Engine-Flask-Application
In this project, I executed the deployment of a Python-based Flask web application onto Google App Engine, utilizing its robust infrastructure and scalability features. By seamlessly integrating the GitHub repository with Google Cloud Source Repositories, I established a streamlined Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline.

To enhance the code quality and ensure seamless updates, I integrated Cloud Build, which facilitated automated unit testing and deployment of code modifications to App Engine. This process effectively reduced manual intervention and mitigated the risk of introducing potential errors.

Furthermore, I incorporated a custom domain name acquired through Google Domains, thus providing a professional and user-friendly web address for the application, bolstering its credibility and overall user experience.
