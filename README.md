# GCP-App-Engine-Flask-Application
In this project I deployed a python flask application onto Google App Engine. I setup continuous deployment by linking Github repository to Cloud Source Repositories and added a Cloud Build Trigger to perform unit testing on my code and to automatically deploys any updates to my code to App Engine. I also added a custom domain name using Google domains.
